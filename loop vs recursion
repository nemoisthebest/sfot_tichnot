Recursion doesn't need a condition to be satisfied before it can run.
Recursion has limits to its execution. This is mainly because functions are stored on the Stack Memory, which has a maximum size. 
In comparison, loops are stored in dynamic memory, where variables can be created indefinitely.
The execution of a recursive function is relatively slower than loops.
